# BSOD

This is a simple BSOD that is executed every time you log in to your machine, its created to have fun with it because this doesn't cause any damage to your PC.

Why this BOSD is not warmfull:
This BOSD is just a inicialization of windows on top of the one running and that causes the windows to BOSD with CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED (the main windows crash because of the new inicialization of it).

But how to stop this? :

You can stop this by removing the to files injected to your windows folder called WindowsUpdate.cmd and WindowsUpdate.xml 
(
for non tech andys:
  C:\Windows\WindowsUpdate.xml
  C:\Windows\WindowsUpdate.cmd
)


But how the FCK im gonna remove if i can't pass from log in?
You go in safe mode and then remove the files or you can use the CMD of the troubleshooting and run rm C:\Windows\WindowsUpdate.xml and rm C:\Windows\WindowsUpdate.cmd .

If you dont know how to go in safe mode or use the CMD of troubleshooting just check a video or google it, is not that hard :)

So, use it freely, prank some friends and have fun with it :) 

DISCLAIMER:
If you use the program and you have any troubles of removing after the use please don't complain just follow the instructions and you are good to go (even if you follow and doesn't remove, in that case is your problem, i don't take any resposabilities if some damage can happen because in first place this program is not build for creating damage).
